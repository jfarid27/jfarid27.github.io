*"Its in words that the magic is -- Abracadabra. Open Sesame, and the rest -- but the magic words in one story aren't magical in the next. The real magic is to understand which words work, and when, and for what: the trick is to learn the trick..." - John Barth, Chimera*

My daily routine involves solving interesting problems at interfaces between business, customers, and computers. I'm largely
aligned with data oriented, iterable solutions, but I occasionally don't mind a stroll into the depths of a particular problem.
In my past life, I would call myself a Full-Stack Engineer, where I focused on building end to end solutions in product development.
After a few rounds, I found my specialty is in developing "solutions" more than "features", and after a happy client or 3 during late night
escapades in the consulting space, I wanted to make that more of a priority. Currently, I focus on strategy, seeking to 
leverage my experiences across a wide range of areas to help businesses in a variety of open-ended technology problems.

If you're in need of some *magic*, feel free to reach out.
